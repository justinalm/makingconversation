For Episode 9, we chat with [Alex Nelson](https://twitter.com/alexnelson) and [Beau House](https://twitter.com/BeauHouse) of [Post Projects](https://twitter.com/Post_Projects). We chat about how they met, started a design company, and decided to call it _Post Projects_. We talk about their design values, the Post Projects studio space, and ‘good guy’ rates. We discussed their work for [Brassneck Brewery](http://brassneck.ca/), [Revolver Coffee](http://revolvercoffee.ca/), and [Umbra Shift](http://www.umbrashift.com/). We ended our conversation chatting about the most memorable project they’ve worked on, the three words they want people to use when describing their work, their current level of satisfaction, and the kind of projects they’d like to work on in the future.
