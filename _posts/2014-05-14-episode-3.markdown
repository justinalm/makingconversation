Karston Smith is a graphic designer and more at LuLuLemon. We talk about getting building permits at City Hall and how wack their yellow highlighters are. We come to the conclusion that when you’re learning something you’re interested in, learning isn’t painful. Justin realizes Sketch.app is great for UI design but not architectural drawings. We talk about acronyms, doing redneck things, design process at LuLuLemon, kombucha, crazy things yogis say, the art & design scene in Calgary, Karston’s art practice, and his upcoming exhibition.

## Quick Notes
- Everyone had pretty good/insane week prior to the show. Yeah, life’s a bitch 
- City Hall used a straight up ‘Yellow’ highlighter to reject Justin’s architectural drawings 
- Are you thinking of doing early morning line up at City Hall? Expect to see at least 30 people lined up from 7 AM. Gosh, get a life! 
- We agreed that learning shouldn’t be painful. Down with the ‘No Pain No Gain’ quote! 
- Anyone out there thinking of drawing architectural site plan? DO NOT USE a software called “[SKETCH](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)” 
- Saskatchewan is middle of nowhere 
- Justin was very saddened by the fact that Karston has never watched the movie called ‘Cool Runnings’ 
- Shawn started zoning out after 15 minutes of the show 
- In-depth talk about Yoga Pants 
- Apparently illustrations on Karston’s website are all his 
- Shawn’s network was completely down at the end of the show (he blames [Stephen Harper](http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/prime-minister-stephen-harper) for this incident)
