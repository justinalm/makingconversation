description: Jace shares with us about about his passion for comics, his search for originality as an artist, failing to get into art school and then getting into art school to realize his conception of art was wrong. We chatted about his work at The Sequence Group and what it means to be a digital artist. We wrap by discussing his teaching practice, participating in community art events, his discontent, and how he would like to be remembered.
