This show is a little different than our previous shows. If you’ve been wondering why there hasn’t be an episode posted for a few weeks, it’s because Justin and Shawn have been travelling. Shawn went to Justin’s homeland and Justin went to Shawn’s. We thought it would be fun to share highlights, annoying aspects of culture, and our general impressions of art and design in each other’s homelands. Come with us on a walk and talk.
