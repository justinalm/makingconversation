For Episode 10, we chat with [Ryan Romero](http://www.ryanromero.ca/) and [Travis Collier](https://twitter.com/traviscollier) of [Clou Studio Inc.](http://www.cloustudioinc.com/). We cracked beers and discussed how they met, started a design company, nd realized their practice is like MasterChef Junior. We talk about their design values, where they find inspiration, and their process when working with clients. We discussed their work for [Anita Sikma](http://anitasikma.com/), [Radicle Juice Shop](http://radiclejuice.com/), and [The Lab Magazine](http://thelabmagazine.com/). We ended our conversation chatting about the most memorable project they’ve worked on and their level of satisfaction.
