## Quick Notes

- Even though many of our friends didn’t listen to our first episode, we went ahead and interviewed Kriza, the owner of Trim Projects.  
- We learned why Kriza decided to launch the Trim Projects after her emotional meltdown and identity crisis in 2012.  
- There was extensive conversation about North Korean.  
- Kriza confessed that she punched Alvin (from [Studio Faculty](http://studiofaculty.com/)) in the face five times while they were working together on the Trim website. 
- She is sad the print industry is slowly dying. 
- She talks about her recent project, which is not top-secret, but classified information. 
- She confessed that she secretly likes Lulu Lemon’s yoga pants.
- Justin & Shawn realized their biggest competitor is not [On Second Thought](http://www.onsecondthoughtpodcast.com/), but the church.
