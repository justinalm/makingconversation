For Episode 11, we chatted with Ross Milne of [Working Format](http://www.workingformat.com). We discussed Mr. Milne’s experience studying type design in the [Type and Media Masters program](http://www.kabk.nl/pageEN.php?id=16) at [The Royal Academy of Art](http://www.kabk.nl/) in The Hague. We talked about the founding of Working Format, how they named the company, and their design mentality of, “let’s just do this”. We discussed the work Ross has done on the fonts [Charlie](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/charlie), [Publico](https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/publico), and [Stag](https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/stag). We talked about the practice of font naming, font marketing, how people use fonts, Australia’s love for Ross’ work, and how fonts live in the software ecosystem. We talked about Working Format’s community oriented initiative [The Platform Gallery](http://www.theplatformgallery.ca/) and their ambition to get art and design into the everyday lives of Vancouverites.
